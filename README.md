Simon game for webprogramming 260

what I learned is that through HTML we can connect different webpages together. it is nice to have the structure of HTML and as long as everything is clear and not cluttered it is easy to follow along and add new elements to your website.
I also lerned that with the ./deployFiles.sh -k <yourpemkey> -h <yourdomain> -s <subdomain> we can have differnt sub domain names and with this different websites.
